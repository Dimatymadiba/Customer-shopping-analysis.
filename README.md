# Customer shopping dashboard üõíüõçÔ∏è

### Project overview
The Customer Shopping Dashboard project integrates Excel, SQL, and Power BI to deliver in-depth insights into consumer purchasing behaviors. Data from the retail customer table is meticulously extracted and refined using SQL to maintain precision and relevance. Excel aids in preliminary data manipulation and exploratory analysis. Subsequently, Power BI is used to develop an interactive dashboard that visualizes critical metrics, including the total number of customers, average age, purchasing patterns, and sales performance. This cohesive approach promotes data-driven decision-making and enhances the comprehension of customer trends.
